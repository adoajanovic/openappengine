Background : 
-----------
The Workflow architecture is used to execute services in the context of a flow. 
Every Step executed in the flow represents a Service. So you need to implement the StepHandler interface.
The current version of the AppFlow supports only Linear Sequential Workflows.
The workflow related architecture is wired using basic Spring wiring. CHECK workflow-context.xml

TODO :
------
Each flow has an associated flow context. Setting-up the paramater passing between the steps.

Steps :
----------
In order to add a new workflow to the system, you need to :
i. Add a new workflow Xml to the classpath of the Workflow Engine.
ii.Add the file name of this workflow in the workflow-context.xml.
iii.Ensure each step implements the StepHandler interface.

Example Workflow.xml file:
------------------------------
<appflow id="exampleWorkflow">
	<step id="step1" sequence="1" stepHandler="com.ms.appflow.tests.TestStep1Handler">
		<params>
			<param type="in" name="name" class="java.lang.String"></param>
			<param type="out" name="accountNo" class="java.lang.String"></param>
		</params>
	</step>
	<step id="step2" sequence="2" stepHandler="com.ms.appflow.tests.TestStep2Handler">
		<params>
			<param type="in" name="accountNo" class="java.lang.String"></param>
		</params>
	</step>
</appflow>
